# Codeclause-Internship(Plagarism Checker)
 Downloads the necessary NLTK resources.
 Preprocesses the input text by tokenizing it, converting to lowercase, and removing stop words.
 Calculates the similarity ratio between the preprocessed texts using SequenceMatcher.
 By preprocessing the text and removing stop words, the code is more effective at detecting plagiarism in a way that is less sensitive to minor variations like stopwords and casing.
 Remember that plagiarism detection is a complex task, and this example is still relatively simple. More advanced techniques might involve using word embeddings, TF-IDF, and machine learning models trained on large datasets for better accuracy.
